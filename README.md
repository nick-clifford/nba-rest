# Predicting when NBA Stars will rest

*This was initially a group class project that I've been interested in continuing*

Inactivity among NBA players has been on the rise in the past 5 years. While injury risk has remained relatively constant, the recent seasons have seen an uptick in star players electing not to take the court during regular-season games to mitigate the risks of injury and fatigue during the playoffs. Modeling the likelihood that a player takes the court for a given game can be advantageous for opposing teams who can develop gameplans around the lineup theyâ€™re most likely to face as opposed to the best lineup their opponents can assemble. It also has applications in sports betting and fan experience, where fantasy lineups are set with this information in mind, and insurance policies are being offered to those who purchased tickets in the event a given player does not take the court. Our goal is to utilize neural networks to build a model that predicts whether a given player will sit out for a particular game. Currently, similar existing models rely on logistic regression but could be developed using any machine learning solution aimed at binary classification, including neural networks.
